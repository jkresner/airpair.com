## Server-side and Client-side Templates
Hi :{} I'm Jonathon, you can follow me at [@hackerpreneur](http://twitter.com/hackerpreneur) to keep tabs on my 90 day vision quest to show how powerful AirPairing can be. AirPair is my 3rd startup. The new airpair.com code base - which I started today - is the 6th code base in my startup career that I've started. I spent years learning, getting stuck and destroying myself to multiple times giving up on previous companies. **So I set out to create a service that would stop people giving up because of technology limitations** before they could watch their business assumptions play out. I've been lucky to collect great team members, go through YCombinator and get backed by some amazing Silicon Valley investors along the way.

AirPair has helped me overcome technology challenges in dribs and drabs. But the ultimate vision of on-demand elastic knowledge, that makes up 5% of your human resources and multiplies your productivity has not yet been lived. I think it's a mixture of the following barriers:

- 1) Cost - I've never had a budget for AirPairing > 5% of the time.
- 2) Friction - The current AirPair.com needs to be way faster at hooking you up with help.
- 3) Dedication - I haven't dedicated myself to learning new coding tricks since I started AirPair.

### 1.1 Cost
Truth is AirPair only works when there's a project with a proper development budget. Getting the best people to work with you isn't cheap. You can work with cheaper competitors, but if you are serious about multiplying your productivity, you need to invest like you do in full time resources. Now that we have funding, I'm going to use it and show you my spend through the 90 days.

### 1.2 Friction
The current AirPair site is not so great - it's still the original MVP I build 18 months ago. I'm quite proud of it and will be blogging about my philosophy *"Release Often, Release Dirty"*. But yeah, it's time for a 10x improvement on expert response time and matching quality. <a href="http://twitter.com/home?status=@hackerprenuer I would love to be a beta tester for the new ap" target="_blank">Tweet at me</a> if you'd like to be a beta tester. I'll be releasing a build every week for feedback and bug squashing help.

### 1.3 Dedication
AirPairing is about consuming knowledge at warp-speed **while** you see your project come to life. Learning is tiring and AirPairing properly involves buying in up-front with as much dedication as you would when studying a new course. For the last 18 months, I've been context switching from development, marketing and investor relations. This is the first time I'm dedicating 3 months straight of focus to code. I'm switching from Backbone.js and ready to become an AngularJS ninja.
