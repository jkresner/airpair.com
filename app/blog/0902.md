## 1 A Pure AngularJS Feature

To get fully into Angular, I've decided to build a whole feature set "Singing up to Attend Workshops" in pure AngularJS with no server-side templates. The rough feature set is:

### 2.1 AngularJS Routers

, the data is linked with the Angular router to update the it's associate template.

### 2.2 AngularJS Controllers & $scope

Unlike <i>BackboneJS</i> Views, which are some form of hybrid, Angular controllers really are controllers. They feel like a Rails controller, that has main purpose of handling data, but instead of database calls you make network requests. The one difference is that AngularJS controllers don't really return a result to render the data. Instead you focus only on changing the local $scope (or self) object.
When ever you make a change the $scope object, angular takes care of everything for you. At first glance you might think, Angular update on a polling system, but it doesn't. Instead the framework has various hooks to check in when things like http calls happen. This is why angular uses its own `$http` rather than `jquery.ajax`.

`$rootScrope` is a special scope that is accessible in all controllers and all templates.

### 2.3 AngularJS Directives

Restricting it to `E` so it's an elements. The template `sideNav.html` is loaded. `$attrs` is the attributes on the directive tag (`tags=tags`). `$eval` is grabbing the tags of the parent view.
