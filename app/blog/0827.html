<h2 id="sec-1"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> Why 90 days of AirPairing?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">

<p>Hi :{} I'm Jonathon, you can follow me at <a href="http://twitter.com/hackerpreneur" target="_blank">@hackerpreneur</a> to keep tabs on my 90 day vision quest to show how powerful AirPairing can be. AirPair is my 3rd startup. The new airpair.com code base - which I started today - is the 6th code base that I've started from scratch during my startup career. I spent years learning, getting stuck and destroying myself to the point of giving up on my previous companies. <b>I decided to build a way cheat technical success for myself and other entrepreneurs wanting to embed their dreams in code</b>. so I set out to create a service that would stop people giving up because of technology limitations before they could watch their business assumptions play out. I've been lucky to meet great team members, go through YC and get backed by some amazing Silicon Valley Investors along the way.<p>

<p>AirPair has definitely helped me overcome technology challenges in dribs and drabs. I've also REALLY enjoyed helping others as a Backbone.js expert. But the ultimate vision of on-demand elastic knowledge that makes up 15% of your software team and multiplies your productivity has not yet been lived. I think it's a mixture of being new and the following barriers:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Cost - I've never had a budget for AirPairing 15% of the time.</oi>
  <li>Friction - AirPair.com is too slow to get you help for anything as you need it.</li>
  <li>Dedication - I've never blocked off my focus to learn as I built.</li>  
</ol>

<h3 id="sec-1-1"><span>1.1</span> Cost</h3>
<div id="text-1-1">
  <p>Truth is AirPair only works when there's a project with a real development budget. Getting the best people to work with you isn't cheap. You can work with cheaper competitors, but if you are serious about multiplying you productivity, you need to invest like you do in your full time resources. Until we got funding, I couldn't afford it. I'm going to keep track and show you my spend the whole way through the 90 days.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="sec-1-2"><span>1.2</span> Friction</h3>
<div id="text-1-2">
  <p>Yup the current AirPair site is not so great. I'm quite proud of it and will be blogging about my philosophy "Release Often, Release Dirty" another time. But yeah, it's time for something way better and in 90 days I promise a 10x improvement on expert response time and matching quality. <a href="http://twitter.com/home?status=@hackerprenuer I would love to be a beta tester for the new ap" target="_blank">Tweet at me</a> if you'd like to be a beta tester. I'll be releasing a build every week for feedback and bug squashing.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="sec-1-3"><span>1.3</span> Dedication</h3>
<div id="text-1-3">
  <p>AirPairing is about consuming knowledge at warp-speed <b>while</b> you see your project come to life. Learning is tiring and AirPairing involves you buying in up-front with as much dedication as you would to studying a course. For the first 18 months I've been context switching from development, marketing and investor relations. This is the first time in the history of AirPair I'm dedicating 3 months of focus on code. I'm switching from Backbone.js to AngularJS and ready to become an Angular ninja.</p>
</div>


<h2 id="sec-2"><span>2</span> Choosing MEAN Stack <code style="font-size:18px">(MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS & NodeJS)</code></h2>
<div id="text-2">
  <p>Having used <code>MongoDB</code> now for a year, I've come to like document driven databases because it's a fast way to develop. I like nesting documents and making almost no joins. It helps with writing less code and making fewer database and http requests. There are problems with keeping replicated data up to date. It may be a problem in the future and time to switch to SQL eventually, but for now Mongo is great and saves me having to think about serialization.</p>

  <p>I'm not one for religious conversations on which languages and frameworks to use. I like mainstream technologies that are easy to use and help you get a lot of shit done quickly. I came from .net, where I used to write in c# for server side and various javascript frameworks for client-side. I think server-side is getting less and less important as most code is moving into the client. Full-stack javascript meant I didn't need to learn a new language and could instead become very proficient in javascript. It also means the folks (hopefully you) that will eventually come join me on the AirPair code base only need one skill instead of two. <code>NodeJS</code> took some getting used to, but I really like it.
  </p>

  <p>I really love Backbone.js, but having tried to teach it to a few people and then watch them grasp <code>AngularJS</code> way quicker, I've got a feeling itss 3-4 times easy to pick up and quicker to build in than Backbone.js. It's also the most widely adopted and quickly growing front-end framework. I've seen that not only on the notorious graphs of people searching for AngularJS, but first hand with how many requests we get for help with Angular.</p>
</div>


<h2 id="sec-3"><span>3</span> Gulp as an Application Assembler</h2>
<div id="text-3">
  <p>The last version of airpair.com was built using <a href="http://brunch.io/">brunch.io</a> as it's application assembler to compile, combine, concat and minify javascript (coffeescript), css (sass) and auto update changes while developing. I really liked it, but a few engineers I worked with didn't. I think the main thing they were annoyed at was needing to re-start the brunch server when making server-side changes and only client-side changes were automatically reflected.</p>
  <p>I knew about <code>grunt</code> as an alternative to brunch, but I'd actually not heard of <code>gulp</code>. Apparently it's the latest and greatest. Thanks to a quick chat in my AirPair Angular War Room with my support experts including Matias Nemila (AngularJS Core Team), Uri Shaked (AngularJS Google Developer Expert) and Ari Lerner (Author of ng-book and ng-newsletter), I was quickly pointed in the optimal direction without needing to spend hours on research.
  </p>
  <p>The main pulls of gulp are code based configuration vs declarative and streaming (faster) builds. This <a href="http://markdalgleish.github.io/presentation-build-wars-gulp-vs-grunt/" target="_blank">awesome Grunt vs Gulp slide deck</a> by Mark Dalgleish help me appreciate the differences quickly.</p>

  <p>In our first hour, Uri and I setup Gulp to wrap nodemon for auto server-side code reloads, compiling of LESS and browser LiveReload to see client side changes appear automatically and instantly. This is already a really nice improvement on my previous work flow. I feel I'm already coding 10% faster from the get go.</p>
