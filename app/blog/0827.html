<h2 id="sec-1"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> Why 90 days of AirPairing?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">

<p>Hi :{} I'm Jonathon, you can follow me at <a href="http://twitter.com/hackerpreneur" target="_blank">@hackerpreneur</a> to keep tabs on my 90 day vision quest to show how powerful AirPairing can be. AirPair is my 3rd startup. The new airpair.com code base - which I started today - is the 6th code base in my startup career that I've started. I spent years learning, getting stuck and destroying myself to multiple times giving up on previous companies. <b>So I set out to create a service that would stop people giving up because of technology limitations</b> before they could watch their business assumptions play out. I've been lucky to collect great team members, go through YCombinator and get backed by some amazing Silicon Valley investors along the way.<p>

<p>AirPair has helped me overcome technology challenges in dribs and drabs. But the ultimate vision of on-demand elastic knowledge, that makes up 5% of your human resources and multiplies your productivity has not yet been lived. I think it's a mixture of the following barriers:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Cost - I've never had a budget for AirPairing > 5% of the time.</oi>
  <li>Friction - The current AirPair.com needs to be way faster at hooking you up with help.</li>
  <li>Dedication - I haven't dedicated myself to learning new coding tricks since I started AirPair.</li>  
</ol>

<h3 id="sec-1-1"><span>1.1</span> Cost</h3>
<div id="text-1-1">
  <p>Truth is AirPair only works when there's a project with a proper development budget. Getting the best people to work with you isn't cheap. You can work with cheaper competitors, but if you are serious about multiplying your productivity, you need to invest like you do in full time resources. Now that we have funding, I'm going to use it and show you my spend through the 90 days.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="sec-1-2"><span>1.2</span> Friction</h3>
<div id="text-1-2">
  <p>The current AirPair site is not so great - it's still the original MVP I build 18 months ago. I'm quite proud of it and will be blogging about my philosophy <i>"Release Often, Release Dirty"</i>. But yeah, it's time for a 10x improvement on expert response time and matching quality. <a href="http://twitter.com/home?status=@hackerprenuer I would love to be a beta tester for the new ap" target="_blank">Tweet at me</a> if you'd like to be a beta tester. I'll be releasing a build every week for feedback and bug squashing help.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="sec-1-3"><span>1.3</span> Dedication</h3>
<div id="text-1-3">
  <p>AirPairing is about consuming knowledge at warp-speed <b>while</b> you see your project come to life. Learning is tiring and AirPairing properly involves buying in up-front with as much dedication as you would when studying a new course. For the last 18 months, I've been context switching from development, marketing and investor relations. This is the first time I'm dedicating 3 months straight of focus to code. I'm switching from Backbone.js and ready to become an AngularJS ninja.</p>
</div>


<h2 id="sec-2"><span>2</span> Choosing MEAN Stack <code style="font-size:18px">(MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS & NodeJS)</code></h2>
<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/media-p.slid.es/uploads/jbpionnier/images/196683/mean_small_vertical.png" style="margin:0 20px 15% 0px" />
<div id="text-2" style="width:580px;display:inline-block">
  <p>Having used <code>MongoDB</code> for a year, I've grown to like document driven databases. It's a fast way to develop. I like nesting documents and avoiding joins. It leads to less code, fewer database trips and less http requests. There are problems and overhead with replicated data, which may lead us to switch to SQL eventually, but for now Mongo is suites our product and development styles really well.</p>

  <p>I'm not one for religious debates on which languages to use. I like technologies that <code>(a)</code> help you get a lot of shit done quickly <code>(b)</code> lots of people know and are easy to hire for. I came from .net, where I used to write in c# on the server and various javascript on the client-side. Full-stack javascript with <code>NodeJS</code> and <code>ExpressJS</code> meant I didn't need to learn a new language and could become double proficient in one.
  </p>

  <p>I really love <code>Backbone.js</code>, but having tried to teach it to a few people and watch them struggle and then grasp <code>AngularJS</code> way quicker, I've got a feeling its going to be 3-4 times easier to lean and build on. It's also the most widely adopted and quickly growing front-end framework. I've seen that not only on the notorious graphs of people searching for AngularJS, but first hand with how many requests we get for help with Angular.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="sec-3"><span>3</span> Gulp as an Application Assembler</h2>
<img src="https://raw2.github.com/gulpjs/artwork/master/gulp-2x.png" style="margin:0 20px 15% 20px;width:160px;float:right" />
<div id="text-3">
  <p>The last version of airpair.com was built using <code><a href="http://brunch.io/" target="_blank">brunch.io</a></code> as the application assembler to compile, combine, concat and minify javascript (coffeescript), css (sass) and watch / auto rebuild changes while developing. I really liked it, but a few engineers I worked with didn't. I think the main thing they were annoyed at was needing to re-start the brunch server when making server-side changes and only client-side changes were automatically reflected.</p>
  <p>I knew about <code><a href="http://gruntjs.com/" target="_blank">grunt</a></code> as an alternative to brunch, but I'd actually not heard of <code><a href="http://gulpjs.com/" target="_blank">gulp</a></code> - the latest and greatest. Thanks to a quick chat in my AirPair Angular War Room with my support experts including Matias Nemila (AngularJS Core Team), Uri Shaked (AngularJS Google Developer Expert) and Ari Lerner (Author of ng-book and ng-newsletter), I was quickly pointed in the optimal direction without needing to spend hours on research.
  </p>
  <p>The main pulls of gulp are code based configuration vs declarative and streaming (faster) builds. This <a href="http://markdalgleish.github.io/presentation-build-wars-gulp-vs-grunt/" target="_blank">awesome Grunt vs Gulp slide deck</a> by Mark Dalgleish help me appreciate the differences quickly.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="sec-3-1"><span>3.1</span> nodemon</h3>
<div id="text-3-1">
  <p>nodemon is a daemon that watches javascript files that make up your node app and restart the node server when any changes are observed. We installed <code>gulp-nodemon</code> in minutes so that the annoyance I had in my last workflow of manually restarting the node server was gone. I really like that I don't need multiple terminals and multiple commands and it's all taken care of by gulp.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="sec-3-2"><span>3.2</span> Less</h3>
<div id="text-3-2">
  <p>I ended up opting for Less because you don't need ruby or c++ to compile. With <code>gulp-less</code> we got things compiling to css relatively quick, though I got caught on having a stylesheet link without a text/css attribute that held us up for a few minutes.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="sec-3-3"><span>3.3</span> LiveReload</h3>
<div id="text-3-3">
  <p>LiveReload is a mechanism to auto-refresh the browser when a change occurs so you don't have to manually hit refresh. It's really nice for css editing and proof reading blog posts like this :{}. I might have fiddled with this for quite a while, but Uri knew what he was doing and guided me through setting up both <code>gulp-livereload</code> and <code>connect-livereload</code> on the node side. I love knocking things out as if I've done it a hundred times before.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="sec-4"><span>4</span> Summary on starting my first Mean Stack App</h2>
<p>In our first hour, Uri and I setup Gulp to wrap nodemon for auto server-side code reloads, compiling of LESS and browser LiveReload to see client side changes appear automatically and instantly. This is already a really nice improvement on my previous work flow. I feel I'm already coding 10% faster from the get go.</p>
