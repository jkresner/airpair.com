## 1 AirPair Development Philosophy

We place the following prioritization in our coding culture.

1. Revenue generating features
2. User experience
3. Best practices / maintainability

There are some tough application architecture decisions to make where (1), (2) & (3) can be at at odds. Templating architecture is one area where where our prioritization  probably conflicts with other developer cultures.

## 2 Server and client-side templates
 The main issues with server-side vs client-side template architectures are SEO (important for revenue), sharing of pages (again revenue) and flickering loading experiences of dynamic vs static pages (user experience). I've got some ideas about what I think the best solution is, but am very interested to explore most the following options with some of the best experts on the subject:

### 2.1 Pure client-side templates
Matias Niemila is an AngularJS core team member. He is championing an application architecture with no server side templates. There are compelling reasons for this type of architecture. You can build an extremely efficient data API and then deploy all your client side JavaScript and templates to a CDN which propagates your assets all over the world and effectively makes your app as fast and far away your data API is. This sort of architecture is really good for applications with evenly distributed global users bases.

### 2.2 Mixing server and client templates
Another approach is to do double the work and leverage the best of both worlds. In this architecture part of your app could be deployed on a CDN architecture and the pages that need to be search indexed and shared could be served with server-side template (e.g. in nodeJS say jade) by your servers. Drawbacks of mixed templates are increased complexity with having to define both server-side and client-side routes that hopefully will not conflict with each other and needing to know and maintain multiple template languages.

### 2.3 Shared templates
An cool optimization that gets rid of the last drawback, and that I had with the previous version of airpair.com was using `handlesbars` as the client-side template language for `Backbone.js` on the client AND with express on the server. I was able to thus reuse the exact same templates for both. I'm not sure if this is possible with AngularJS templates, but it's something I'd like to look into.

### 3.1 Install AngularJS with Bower

Package managers have become synonymous in server-side coding. Ruby Gems, nuget, pip, npm - you've heard of them and they're all awesome. Turns out the cool font-end kids have come up with their own same concept of a font-end package manager called `bower` which is managed by a `bower.json` file similar to a `package.json` file for npm / node_modules.

`.borwerrc` file tells bower where to install packages. In our case the `public` dir.

<!--?prettify lang=cli linenums=false?-->

	npm install bower -g
	bower install angular --save

### 3.2 Testing with karam
We didn't get as far as testing anything during the session, but I did learn about [`karma`](http://karma-runner.github.io/) and Matias's approach to testing. In airpair.com v0, I used `phantomjs` a headless web browser to invoke `mocha` to execute integration style tests. With karma, that solution is no longer necessary but it's a slightly different approach. Rather than being a headless web browser, karama is a process that launches real browsers like chrome and firefox, tests it and displays the results in terminal.

## 4 First AngularJS Lessons

### 4.1 AngularJS Routers

### 4.2 AngularJS Controllers & $scope

Angular doesn't update on a polling system, but on hooks on things like http calls. Which is why angular uses its own `$http` rather than `jquery.ajax`.

`$rootScrope` is a special scope that is accessible in all controllers and all templates. In our case since we have the 

### 4.3 AngularJS Dependency Injection

### 4.4 AngularJS Directives

Restricting it to `E` so it's an elements. The template `sideNav.html` is loaded. `$attrs` is the attributes on the directive tag (`tags=tags`). `$eval` is grabbing the tags of the parent view. 

### 5 Summary

Golden rule is a controller only handles data. Instead of database calls you make api requests.
