## 1 AirPair Development Philosophy

- User experience trumps best practices.
- Speed of development is important.

## 2 Server and Client-Side Templates

### 1.3 Dedication


## 2 Setting up AngularJS

### 3.1 Install Angular with Bower

`.borwerrc` file tells bower where to install packages. In our case the `public` dir.

<!--?prettify lang=cli linenums=false?-->

	npm install bower -g
	bower install angular --save

### 3.2 Testing with karam
We didn't get as far as testing anything during the session, but I did learn about [`karma`](http://karma-runner.github.io/) and Matias's approach to testing. In airpair.com v0, I used `phantomjs` a headless web browser to invoke `mocha` to execute integration style tests. With karma, that solution is no longer necessary but it's a slightly different approach. Rather than being a headless web browser, karama is a process that launches real browsers like chrome and firefox, tests it and displays the results in terminal.

## 4 First AngularJS Lessons

### 4.1 AngularJS Routers

### 4.2 AngularJS Controllers & $scope

Angular doesn't update on a polling system, but on hooks on things like http calls. Which is why angular uses its own `$http` rather than `jquery.ajax`.

`$rootScrope` is a special scope that is accessible in all controllers and all templates. In our case since we have the 

### 4.3 AngularJS Dependency Injection

### 4.4 AngularJS Directives

Restricting it to `E` so it's an elements. The template `sideNav.html` is loaded. `$attrs` is the attributes on the directive tag (`tags=tags`). `$eval` is grabbing the tags of the parent view. 

### 5 Summary

Golden rule is a controller only handles data. Instead of database calls you make api requests.
