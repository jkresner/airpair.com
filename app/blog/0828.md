## 1 Why 90 days of AirPairing?
Hi :{} I'm Jonathon, you can follow me at [@hackerpreneur](http://twitter.com/hackerpreneur) to keep tabs on my 90 day vision quest to show how powerful AirPairing can be. AirPair is my 3rd startup. The new airpair.com code base - which I started today.


- 1) Cost - I've never had a budget for AirPairing > 5% of the time.
- 2) Friction - The current AirPair.com needs to be way faster at hooking you up with help.
- 3) Dedication - I haven't dedicated myself to learning new coding tricks since I started AirPair.

### 1.1 Cost


### 1.2 Friction
The current AirPair site is not so great - it's still the original MVP I build 18 months ago. I'm quite proud of it and will be blogging about my philosophy *"Release Often, Release Dirty"*. But yeah, it's time for a 10x improvement on expert response time and matching quality. <a href="http://twitter.com/home?status=@hackerprenuer I would love to be a beta tester for the new ap" target="_blank">Tweet at me</a> if you'd like to be a beta tester. I'll be releasing a build every week for feedback and bug squashing help.

### 1.3 Dedication


## 2 Setting up AngularJS

### 2.1 Install Angular with Bower

<!--?prettify lang=cli linenums=false?-->

	npm install bower -g
	bower install angular --save

And in javascript 

<!--?prettify lang=javascript linenums=true?-->

	var = function(yo) {
		alert();
	}

### 2.2 Testing with karam
We didn't get as far as testing anything during the session, but I did learn about [`karma`](http://karma-runner.github.io/) and Matias's approach to testing. In airpair.com v0, I used `phantomjs` a headless web browser to invoke `mocha` to execute integration style tests. With karma, that solution is no longer necessary but it's a slightly different approach. Rather than being a headless web browser, karama is a process that launches real browsers like chrome and firefox, tests it and displays the results in terminal.
