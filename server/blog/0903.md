## 1 Fighting Experience w Expert Angels
Don't get me wrong, I love SPAs (Single Page Apps). The previous version of airpair.com didn't have one server-side template for the first 6 months. But I feel pure SPAs often get in the way of business requirements. For example, as soon as we started social share requests, we had to pre-render them on server.

Early 2011 was the first time that I was exposed to the Single Page App CDN Architecture. Refreshing pages during development drove me nuts. The movement that happens while SPAs piecemeal inflate islands of content stops my brain being able to engage a page. For me it's like a gif banner than you can't stop looking at.

The slowest part of your app is transferring data over the Internet. A nice hybrid hack that I like a lot, is a mixed style SPA using server rendering to plop data right on page render that would otherwise require XHRs. The question is, is it worth making 5 extra trips to your API even if the static assets are delivery way quicker by CDN?

My experience says the hybrid approach is the best, but I have some of the most brilliant developers on the planet telling me I should go pure fat client-side. It's hard to ignore being told the same thing by two of them in the same day. I've watched these AngularJS Angels save AirPair customers like the Cenus Bureau hundreds of thousands of dollars with bad architectural decisions. So I'm prepared to give it a shot.
