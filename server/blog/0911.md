## 1 Getting REALLY F*in Stuck

Man, I'm going to build something that will stop you from wondering if you can find someone.

## 2 Express Sessions

Tricky little suckers, problems with our old app having a huge collection. Dive in static files serving cookies

### 2.1 Damn new express modules

-- Cookie parser pass secret
-- Body parse extend url

## 3 Passport req.sessions and req.user

req.session is basically an object that gets persisted as is.

    req.session { cookie: 
      { path: '/',
        _expires: Thu Oct 09 2014 09:39:45 GMT-0700 (PDT),
        originalMaxAge: 2419200000,
        httpOnly: true },
        passport: { user: { _id: '5175efbfa3802cc4d5a5e6ed' } },
      return_to: '/workshops' }

req.user is a passpot specific property in the session. I think it
was a poor choice of naming.
    
    req.user { _id: '5175efbfa3802cc4d5a5e6ed' }

We don't want database hits.


## 4 The AHA, damn freaking live-reload

## 5 Implications on database

??

## 6 Implications on analytics


## 7 Return to and failed messages via custom callback
