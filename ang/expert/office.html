  <h3 class="underline">Expert news</h3>

  <p>Not much to see in your office yet, but <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/airpair/experts.airpair.com/blob/master/docs/features/scheduled/office/office.png">here's a sneak peek</a> from our open source experts repo with some of
    the stuff that's going to be appearing soon.

<!--
  <p>
    The next few weeks we'll be improving the request-reply and bookings flows. Very soon we'll also invite you
    to input notification settings, so we know what AirPairs you'd like to hear about and how often.

In the meantime you can get a headstart and boost your mojo score by submitting posts to our
