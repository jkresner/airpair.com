Hi again {{firstName}},

Hope you've have had some time to look over your responses. Are you happy with your experts? Please tell me straight away if they do not meet your expectations. My personal recommendation is << >> because <<<>>. When you're ready just go back to the page with your replies and hit "Book". Once that's done I'll help you schedule a time with the expert.

P.S. You can buy AirPairing credit in bulk ahead of time and get as much as 20% extra. Once you have credit the cost of each session gets deducted from your balance.
