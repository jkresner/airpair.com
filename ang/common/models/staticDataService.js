  defaultPostMarkdown: `## AirPair Editor Tips

As you type you'll see the preview pane update. The longer your posts gets, the less frequently it will refresh.

To show the latest content immediately, click anywhere (*i.e. blur*) out of the editor.

\* Note that you still need to click **SAVE** to save your changes. If the **SAVE** button is disabled, it means your Markdown is saved.

\* Note to use reserved Markdown characters escape them with a backslash

## Handy Markdown snippits

### Headings

## Use h2 for headings

- h1 is already taken by your post's title, so don't use single # h1 headings

### h3 are good for sub-headings

Together H1s and H2s will appear automatically in your Table of contents. You'll be able to see them later when you click **PREVIEW**.

## Links

Links are easy! Here's link to your posts [AirPair posts section](/posts/me). Here's an absolute link to the [AirPair posts section with a title attribute](https://airpair.com/posts "AirPair Posts").

## Images

Images are similar to links, but with a ! infront:

## Code blocks

Code blocks are the same as github flavored fenced code blocks. You can

\`\`\`
No language specified
\`\`\`

\`\`\`coffeescript
#Code blocks with language
\`\`\`

\`\`\`coffeescript,linenums=true
#Code blocks with language and linenums
() ->
  coolness = true
\`\`\`

\`\`\`javascript,linenums=true
//Code blocks for javascript
function() {
  var coolness = true
}
\`\`\`

`
