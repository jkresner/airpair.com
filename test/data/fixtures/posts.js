A cookie may convey anonymous information about how you browse the Service to us, but does not collect personal information about you. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser so that it can be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Service. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser’s directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you closeS your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Service may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.\n\n#### Log Files:\n\nLog file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you access a web page.

Use of this information by each respective third party analytics service is governed by its privacy policy.\n\n**How We Share Your Information**\n\n#### Personally Identifiable Information: \nCompany may share your personally identifiable information with third parties for the purpose of providing the Service to you. If we do this, such third parties’ use of your information will be bound by this Privacy Policy. We securely transmit your credit card data to our payment processing partner during order processing. We may store personal information in locations outside the direct control of Company (for instance, on servers or databases co-located with hosting providers).\nAs we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or business offerings. Customer, e-mail, and visitor information is generally one of the transferred business assets in these types of transactions. We may also transfer or assign such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, or dissolution.\nWe may share or disclose your information with your consent, such as if you choose to sign on to the Service through a third-party service.

These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on Company. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or web beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content. Company does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent. However, please note that if an advertiser asks Company to show an advertisement to a certain audience and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. In addition, third-party advertisers may use information about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. The techniques these third-party ad servers or ad networks employ do not collect personal information such as your name, email address, postal address or telephone number. You can visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/ to opt out of third-party targeted advertising. The Company Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, third-party advertisers. Please consult the respective privacy policies of such advertisers for more information.\n\n**How We Protect Your Information**\n\nCompany uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Company or guarantee that your information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.\nIn the event that personal information is compromised as a result of a breach of security, Company will promptly notify those persons whose personal information has been compromised.\n\n#### Your Choices About Your Information\n\nYou may, of course, decline to submit personally identifiable information through the Service, in which case Company may not be able to provide certain services to you. You may update or correct your account information and e-mail preferences at any time by logging in to your account.\n\n#### Children’s Privacy\n\nProtecting the privacy of young children is especially important. Company does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register with the Service. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information.\n\n#### Links to Other Web Sites\n\nWe are not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked to or from the Service, nor the information or content contained therein. Please remember that when you use a link to go from the Service to another website, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other website, including those that have a link on our website, is subject to that website’s own rules and policies.\n\n#### Changes to Our Privacy Policy\n\nIf we change our privacy policies and procedures, we will post those changes on this page to keep you aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we may disclose it. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.\nIf you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at team@airpair.com, or send mail to:\n\nAirPair Inc., 875 Howard St, San Francisco, CA 94103\n",

    "md" : "Synopsis\n> Only two scenarios qualify customers for refunds. If you are short on time, \nwe think a minute to read [sec 2.1](#2-1-guarantee-terms) and [sec 3.2](#3-2-delivering-on-schedule) is adequate to understand when customers are entitled to refunds. For full context and the nitty gritty, you\ncan read this policy in full. It covers responsibilities of\ncustomers and experts impacting refunds as well as explicitly flagging some\n(but not all) scenarios that do not qualify.\n\n## 1. AirPair is a Marketplace\n\n### 1.1 Marketplace vs Consulting Services\n\n***AIRPAIR*** <sup>**AIRPAIR** is defined as the services provided through the domain [airpair.com](https://www.airpair.com/)</sup> provides a platform for connecting and facilitating ***CUSTOMER(s)*** <sup>**CUSTOMER** is defined as user *who has paid to* to get software help via AIRPAIR and not had their payment(s) refunded or reversed.</sup> and ***EXPERT(s)*** <sup>**EXPERT** is defined as a user presented on AIRPAIR as a supplier of paid software consulting services</sup> to ***EXCHANGE*** <sup>**EXCHANGE** is defined as a `booking` by a CUSTOMER with payment into AirPair escrow intended for released to the EXPERT upon delivery of software consulting services.</sup> high-end software related consulting services.\n\nBy participating in an EXCHANGE, you accept this Refund Policy and acknowledge:\n1. This Refund Policy is designed in the context that AIRPAIR is a marketplace - and NOT a supplier of Software Consulting Services. \n2. CUSTOMERS are solely responsible for incorporating information, recommendations and code provided by EXPERTS into their own products.\n3. AIRPAIR and EXPERTS are fully indemnified against damages or loss of revenue caused or experienced by CUSTOMERS.\n\n### 1.2 Your responsibilities \n\nHealthy `consumer <-> marketplace <-> supplier` interactions are \nmore complex than traditional `consumer <-> supplier` ecommerce.\n\nTo continue meeting CUSTOMER expectations for fast turnaround and efficient \nEXCHANGE with high-quality available EXPERTS, CUSTOMERS and EXPERTS have duties \ntowards one another to assist in completing EXCHANGES in reasonable timeframes. \nFailure to fulfil responsibilities outlined in sec 3 and sec 4 in a reliable or \ntimely manner impact entitlement to and extent of refunds.\n\n## 2. AirPair Money Back Guarantee\n\nTo save **CUSTOMERS** time researching EXPERTS and availability\n(required on most other platforms), AIRPAIR was designed for \nCUSTOMERS to trust the marketplace in its representation of EXPERTS\nas suitable quality and relevant for a given EXCHANGE. \n\nAIRPAIR provides curated recommendations, ratings and links of social profiles\nto help CUSTOMERS evaluate and choose whom to book. CUSTOMERS are, however, \nultimately responsible for deciding EXPERTs matches their expectations and\nconfirm so implicitly when they continue working past their first hour with any new EXPERT.\n\nCUSTOMERS are entitled to NO QUESTIONS ASKED MONEY BACK WITHIN 5 BUSINESS DAYS\nwithin the constraints outlined in [sec 2.1](#2-1-guarantee-terms).\n\n### 2.1 Guarantee Terms\n> - - - \n**In cases when **CUSTOMER** expectations are NOT met, **AIRPAIR** will fully \nrefund **(or credit)** the total purchase amount, if **CUSTOMER** has **<sub>(1)</sub>** NOT RELEASED ESCROW and **<sub>(2)</sub>** NOT WORKED PAST THEIR FIRST HOUR with an **EXPERT** and <sub>(3)</sub> within 7 days CLAIMED\nVIA EMAIL to team@airpair.com their **EXPERT** was unfit for the presented requirements.**\n- - -\n\n## 3. Expert responsibilities\n\n### 3.1 Confirming delivery time\n\nAIRPAIR allows CUSTOMERS to book EXPERTS before the parties agree on\ndelivery time (most commonly the time of a pairing session). When booked, \npayment is immediately secured in escrow and EXPERTS are expected to proactively \nnegotiate and confirm a delivery time as quickly as possible. If the expert \nhas not confirmed or suggested alternate time options after 12 hours from being\nbooked the customer may swap to another EXPERT.\n\n### 3.2 Delivering on schedule\n\n> - - -\n**In the event an **EXPERT** is (and not the **CUSTOMER** in any way) at fault for failing to completing all scheduled consulting time, **CUSTOMERS** have the right to a full refund (or credit) of all funds associated with the \n**EXCHANGE** that have not been released from escrow.**\n- - -\n\n#### 3.2.1 Live Pairing & Offline Scenarios\n\nMost commonly, delivering scheduled time means punctually attending and being\npresent for the entire length of a live pairing session.\n\nIn the case of offline work, the confirmed booking time represents\nthe agreement of when the work will be complete and handed over.\n\n#### 3.2.2 Partial delivery\n\nIf CUSTOMER and EXPERT originally worked for 10 hours, that were released from from escrow, then the CUSTOMER books the EXPERT for 5 additional hours, but the EXPERT only completes 2 by the delivery time, the CUSTOMER is entitled to a refund (or credit) for the full amount paid for 5 hours.\n\n## 4. Customer responsibilities\n\n### 4.1 Confirming delivery time\n\nAIRPAIR allows CUSTOMERS to book EXPERTS before the parties agree on\ndelivery time (most commonly the time of a pairing session). \n\nCUSTOMER must **engage EXPERTS via chat** as soon as possible to \nlock in delivery. Refunds are not available if a CUSTOMER has not replied to \nan EXPERT via chat within 24 hours of a booking - even if a delivery time is\nnever established.\n\n### 4.2 Honoring Bookings\n\nOnce a CUSTOMER books an EXPERT, they are required to complete the EXCHANGE \nwithin 8 weeks.\n\nRefunds are NOT entitled when:\n1. CUSTOMERS change their mind\n2. Requirements change or become no longer relevant\n3. CUSTOMER is at fault for delaying full completion of EXCHANGE within 8 weeks\n\n### 4.3 Inhibiting delivery\n\nIf a CUSTOMER inhibits an EXPERT from being able to deliver service,\nthe EXPERT is entitled to full payment and refunds are not available.\n\nIn the case of live pairing, if a CUSTOMER's setup or bandwidth inhibits \ncommunications, or they are more than 15 minutes late, the EXPERT is entitled to consider the EXCHANGE complete.\n\n## 5. Unconsumed credit\n\nAirPair offers CUSTOMERS options to purchase <sub>(1)</sub> specific blocks of\n**time** (`\"bookings\"`) locked in with a particular EXPERT and <sub>(2)</sub> **credit** that enables CUSTOMERS to more flexibly deduct amounts from a balance \nwhen EXPERTS, quantity of help and even requirements are not yet known. \n\nCredit often comes with a bonus 5% - 20% extra spend, depending on purchase size \nand is useful for team scenarios where financial controllers prefer their\ncredit card info and purchase additional privileges not to to be shared with \ntheir developers.\n\n### 5.1 Credit expiry\n\nCredit is valid until and expires either:\n\n1. At the end of the current lunar year.\n2. After 3 months, if purchased after Oct 1st in the current year.\n\n### 5.2 Credit is non-refundable\n\nCredit and partial credit purchases are non-refundable *unless* the purchase\nis the CUSTOMERS first purchase via AirPair and their first  EXPERT is claimed \nunfit within the boundaries outlined in Sec 2.1",
