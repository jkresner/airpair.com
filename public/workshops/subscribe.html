    <h1>Subscribe to Workshops Calendar</h1>

    <p>For convenience, we provide an iCal feed that automatically updates as we make changes to the workshops schedule.</p>

    <input type="text" style="width:100%;margin:15px 0 20px 0" value="https://www.google.com/calendar/ical/airpair.co_o3u16m7fv9fc3agq81nsn0bgrs%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics" />

    <p>Make sure your client is setup correctly to receive live changes and that you haven't just imported a static view of the schedule.</p>

    <h2>Google hangouts guide</h2>

    <p>Copy and paste the following url in the "Add by url" dialog.

    <p>If you select the 'Import calendar' option you will NOT see updates to the schedule as they are made.</p>

    <img src="/v1/img/pages/workshops/ical-google-guide-1.png" />

    <p>Once the calendar url is added, you will see "AirCasts" listed down the left and workshops will appear in your calendar..</p>
